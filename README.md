# crypto
Wrote my own webapp for excel sheet encryption.
No need internet access, clean codes.
It can be also be used for internet isolated machines, as well as personal PC.

The first sheet must be named as "memo" with a table of 2 columns.
First column header as "#key", second column header as "#content".

How to install?
- creates a folder "crypto" in your desktop, download the files into it.
- just open the html file using your internet browser.
