<h3>About ACO</h3>
<div id="intro" style="padding:0 16px">  
<p>Accountable Care Organization</p>
&nbsp&nbspAn ACO refers to a group of providers and suppliers of services (e.g., hospitals,<br>
&nbsp&nbspphysicians, and others involved in patient care) that will work together to<br>
&nbsp&nbspcoordinate care for the Medicare fee-for service patients they serve.<br><br>
<p>Goal: </p>
&nbsp&nbspThe goal of an ACO is to deliver seamless, high quality care for Medicare beneficiaries,<br>
&nbsp&nbspinstead of the fragmented care that often results from a fee for-service payment system<br>
&nbsp&nbspin which different providers receive different, disconnected payments.<br>
&nbsp&nbspThe ACO will be a patient-centered organization where the patient and providers<br>
&nbsp&nbspare partners in care decisions.<br>
<br>
<p>The rule: </p>
&nbsp&nbspThe Rule identifies the following elements as key to achieving the aim:<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- person-centeredness<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- coordination of care;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- attentiveness to care transitions;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- efficiency, waste reduction and a focus on use of internal resources, preventative<br>
&nbsp&nbsp  interventions, diversion from and/or coordinated discharges from hospital care,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp  and avoidance of hospital re-admission;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- prompt and regular communication with patients;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- use of data to improve care delivery and outcomes;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- innovation;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp- staff skill-building<br>
<br>
<p>Outcome: </p>
&nbsp&nbspThe ACO model provides a framework of requirements relating to such factors as quality<br>
&nbsp&nbspmeasures, person-centeredness and payment modalities upon which Connecticutâ€™s application of<br>
&nbsp&nbspintegrated care could be based.<br>
